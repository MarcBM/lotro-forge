### 12. Make Footer/Navigation Float
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Implement floating footer and navigation elements for improved user interface experience.

**Solution:** Implemented fixed navbar and footer layout using flexbox with `h-screen` container and `overflow-y-auto` on the main content area. Navbar and footer are now always visible using `flex-none` positioning, while the content area between them is scrollable. Layout uses multi-page approach with standardized base template rather than SPA conversion, maintaining current routing structure while achieving the floating UI goal. Added custom scrollbar styling that matches the LotRO theme with dark track (`#111827`), medium gray thumb (`#2D3748`), and gold hover effect (`#E6D5AC`). Used `!important` declarations and multiple selectors (html, body, main, .overflow-y-auto) to ensure browser compatibility and override defaults.

**Files Modified:**
- `web/templates/base/base.html` - Fixed layout structure
- `web/static/css/style.css` - Custom scrollbar styling
