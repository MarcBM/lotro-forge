## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] **Option A: Automated Setup**
  - [x] Run deployment script: `./scripts/deploy_setup.sh`
- [x] **Option B: Manual Setup**
  - [x] Create fly.io app: `flyctl apps create lotro-forge --org personal`
  - [x] Create data volume: `flyctl volumes create lotro_companion --size 2 --region iad`

### Phase 3: Initial Code Deployment
- [x] Deploy code to fly.io: `flyctl deploy --remote-only`
- [x] Verify app is created: `flyctl status`
- [x] Note: App will not start properly yet (no database/secrets)

### Phase 4: Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set fly.io secrets for environment variables:
  - [ ] `flyctl secrets set LOTRO_FORGE_ENV=production`
  - [ ] `flyctl secrets set LOTRO_FORGE_SECRET_KEY=<your-super-secret-key>`
  - [ ] `flyctl secrets set LOTRO_COMPANION_ROOT=/app/data`
  - [ ] `flyctl secrets set CORS_ORIGINS=https://lotroforge.com,https://www.lotroforge.com`

### Phase 5: Database Setup (ON FLY.IO INSTANCE)
- [ ] Start the app temporarily: `fly machine start <MACHINE_ID>` (get ID from `fly status`)
- [ ] Connect to fly.io instance: `fly ssh console`
- [ ] Navigate to app directory: `cd /app`
- [ ] Set up LOTRO companion data (volume already mounted at /app/data):
  - [ ] Navigate to data directory: `cd /app/data`
  - [ ] Clone LOTRO companion repository: `git clone https://github.com/lotro-companion/lotro-items-db.git lotro-items-db`
  - [ ] Clone LOTRO data repository: `git clone https://github.com/lotro-companion/lotro-data.git lotro-data`
  - [ ] Clone LOTRO icons repository: `git clone https://github.com/lotro-companion/lotro-icons.git lotro-icons`
  - [ ] Navigate back to app: `cd /app`
- [ ] Run database migrations: `python -m alembic upgrade head`
- [ ] Import LOTRO companion data: `python -m scripts.importers.run_import --wipe`
- [ ] Create master user: `python -m scripts.create_master_user`
- [ ] Exit SSH session: `exit`
- [ ] Database connectivity verified

### Phase 6: Start Application
- [ ] Restart app with new configuration: `flyctl deploy --remote-only`
- [ ] Verify app is running: `flyctl status`
- [ ] Check logs: `flyctl logs`
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl https://lotro-forge.fly.dev/health`

### Phase 7: Domain Configuration
- [ ] Add custom domain: `flyctl certs add lotroforge.com`
- [ ] Add www subdomain: `flyctl certs add www.lotroforge.com`
- [ ] Update DNS records at domain registrar
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates: `flyctl certs show lotroforge.com`

### Phase 6: Security Verification
- [ ] CORS settings updated for production
- [ ] Security headers verified
- [ ] Rate limiting considered

## Ongoing Deployment Process

After initial setup is complete, all future deployments will be handled automatically by GitHub Actions:

### Regular Code Deployments
- [ ] Push changes to main branch
- [ ] GitHub Actions automatically:
  - [ ] Runs tests
  - [ ] Builds Docker image
  - [ ] Deploys to fly.io
- [ ] Verify deployment: `flyctl status`
- [ ] Check logs if needed: `flyctl logs`

### Phase 5: Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Health checks configured
- [ ] Logging configured
- [ ] Error tracking set up
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Functionality Tests
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] API endpoints respond properly
- [ ] Database queries work
- [ ] Static files serve correctly
- [ ] Authentication works (if applicable)

### ✅ Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting active

### ✅ Performance Checks
- [ ] Page load times acceptable
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] Static assets cached
- [ ] CDN configured (if applicable)

### ✅ Monitoring Verification
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Logs being generated
- [ ] Error tracking working
- [ ] Metrics being collected

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Monitoring
- [ ] Check application logs weekly
- [ ] Monitor resource usage
- [ ] Review error rates
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly

### Security Updates
