Please refamiliarise yourself with the workspace directory structure. Read the RULES.md and README.md to reacquaint yourself with the project, its purpose, and the principles we are using to develop it. Any terminal commands should be run from within the venv. Any finalised changes should be reflected in the documentation found in the /docs directory. Now continue with whatever I ask you to do next.
