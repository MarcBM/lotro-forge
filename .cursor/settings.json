While LOTRO's stat system can theoretically be optimized perfectly, the sheer number of configurations makes manual optimization infeasible. This tool automates that process.\n\n**How LOTRO's Character System Works:**\nLOTRO characters have Main Stats (which derive into Effective Stats at class-specific rates) and Effective Stats (which can also be gained directly from gear/traits). Effective Stats contribute to combat modifiers like Critical Hit Chance or Physical Damage Mitigation. Most stats have hard caps (e.g., Critical Rating caps at 25% Critical Hit Chance at 225,000 rating). This creates a constrained optimization problem: maximize total stats while not wasting any above their caps, rather than balancing diminishing return curves.\n\n**The Solution - Essence-Based Valuation:**\nUses \"Essences\" (single-stat items) as the fundamental value unit. All stats are expressed in \"Essence Values\" (EV), with items getting a \"Valuable Essence Score\" (VES) and entire builds getting a \"Build Score\" that accounts for stat caps and custom goals.\n\n**Target Users:**\n- Primary: Hardcore high-end players who want maximum optimization without the time investment\n- Secondary: Any player interested in character improvement, with additional user-friendly features planned for lower-end players\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy 2.0+ ORM and PostgreSQL database\n- Frontend: Jinja2 templates with vanilla JavaScript\n- Data Pipeline: Custom XML importers using lxml to process LOTRO game data\n- Migrations: Alembic for database schema management\n\n**Development & Testing:**\n- Uses virtual environment (`venv/`) - all Python commands must be executed with venv activated\n- Web app runs continuously in development mode during work sessions\n- Comprehensive pytest test suite with unit/integration/api categories\n- Coverage reporting across database, web, and scripts modules\n- Custom test runner script for convenient test execution\n\n**Project Structure:**\n- `database/` - Models, connection, and configuration\n- `web/` - FastAPI application:\n  - `app.py` - Main application entry point\n  - `api/` - API endpoints\n  - `routers/` - Route organization\n  - `templates/` - Jinja2 templates\n  - `static/` - CSS, JavaScript, images\n  - `middleware/` - Custom middleware\n  - `config/` - Web app configuration\n- `scripts/` - Data importers and utility scripts\n- `migrations/` - Alembic database migrations\n- `tests/` - Test suite organized by categories\n- `docs/` - Project documentation\n- `TODO.md` - Current work tracking\n\n**Data Flow:**\nTwo distinct aspects: (1) Data importation runs separately from the web app, importing LOTRO game data to the database only when the game updates (roughly every 2-3 months). (2) The web application interfaces with this static game data via GET calls only, while handling user data (builds, sharing) through standard CRUD operations.\n\n**Core Features:**\n1. Accurate character builder that perfectly emulates in-game character sheets\n2. Character stat optimizer that respects 'locked' aspects and finds optimal builds given preferential constraints/goals\n3. Save/load functionality for builds\n4. Explorable database of imported game data\n\n**Future Features:**\n1. Build sharing system for builds, stat goals, and optimizer settings\n2. Personal limitations system through 'armoury' (items owned/accessible) or source restrictions, allowing the optimizer to respect player's current skill level and available resources\n\n## Rules & Focus Points\n\n**Critical Rules:**\n- Never modify imported game data - it is externally managed and must remain untouched\n- Follow established patterns, especially for database operations and common logic which are abstracted\n- Maintain strict separation between static game data and dynamic user data\n- JavaScript must be in separate .js files, never embedded in templates\n\n**Workflow & Communication:**\n- Current release work tracked in kanban-style files: TODO.md, IN_PROGRESS.md, COMPLETED.md, and RELEASE_NOTES.md\n- For release archiving and migration process, see releases/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md\n- Move items between kanban files as work progresses, updating descriptions with current status\n- Suggest additions to TODO.md for out-of-scope items\n- Explain suggestions concisely and outline execution plans before proceeding\n- Pause for technical decisions rather than making assumptions\n- Update documentation for major changes\n\n**Development Standards:**\n- Comprehensive testing for optimization logic and mathematical accuracy\n- Type hints and clear documentation for complex formulas\n- Follow existing database operation patterns"
